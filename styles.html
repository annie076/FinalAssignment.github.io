  <h1>Piano can be incorporated into just about any style of music. Because of that, there are many different styles of piano music. The most well known is classical music. Classical piano music was the first music genre to be played on the piano. Classical musicians and composers popularized the piano when it was first invented. Some very popular classical piano compositions are "Clair de Lune", "Für Elise", and "Gymnopédie". Another popular style of piano music is jazz. Jazz first originated in New Orleans, Louisiana among the African American people in the late 19th century. Oscar Peterson is a well known jazz pianist. Some popular jazz compositions are "Fly Me to the Moon" and "Blue Bossa". </h1>
