  <h1>There are many important pianists throughout the years who have built the basis of piano. One was Frederic Chopin, as pictured on the right. He was a pianist during the Romantic period who despised public performances. Instead, he would perform at private parties for wealthy patrons. Chopin is most known for his piano compositions which are described as "pearly, subtle" and â€œexquisite delicacy and liquid mellowness". Another famous pianist was Scott Joplin, who is also known as the King of Ragtime. He helped in popularizing the ragtime genre with his music which eventually inspired jazz music. "The Maple Leaf Rag" is one of his well known ragtime songs. These figures in piano are the reason that piano is such a popular instrument to this day.</h1>
