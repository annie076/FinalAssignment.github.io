        <h1>The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700. The mechanism he used in his invention is still used in pianos today. In the late 1700s, Sebastian Erard created the repetition mechanism, which allowed a key to be played again before it returned to its original position. This was revolutionary because it allowed pianists to express themselves more in their pieces. Nearly 100 years later, the first overstrung grand piano was created by Steinway & Sons and eventually was advanced into a piano that is very similar to modern pianos. In the 1900s, the piano was considered to be as advanced as it possibly could be. During this period, pianos were able to be produced in industrialized factories which in turn brings us to the pianos we have today.</h1>
