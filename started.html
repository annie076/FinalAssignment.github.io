  <h1>If you want to learn how to play the piano, my best advice would be to take lessons with a teacher. A teacher will start you with the basics, like scales and chords, and help you advance further from there. Some tips to follow when started out with a piano would be to practice every day and have correct playing posture. These two things are important to get a hang of right away so you don't have problems down the road. You can learn more about getting started with the piano here <a href="https://roli.com/blog/getting-started-playing-piano?srsltid=AfmBOop199vLvJVh47f5tLD7cOS_uvSlhNqvQ0_o9l3lsFDn2zKWFqOl">Here</a>.</h1>
